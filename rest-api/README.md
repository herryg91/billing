## Introduction
This project primarily follows a clean architecture pattern and uses a home-made framework called GRSTâ€”a combination of REST-API and gRPC. You can find it here: https://github.com/herryg91/cdd.

## How to Run
Requires: go v1.21 (we recommend v1.23)
```
go mod tidy && go run main.go

// notes: Don't forget to set up the environment variables
```

Docker

```
docker-compose up

// notes: Feel free to update the docker-compose.yml to change the environment variable before run the docker-compose
```

## Project Structure
To better understand the project, here is a quick overview of its main components:

1. Contract: Located in the /contract folder, this contains the API contracts written in Protobuf, providing an easy-to-understand structure.
2. Handler: Located in the /handler folder, it implements what is defined in the contract, leveraging the GRST framework.
3. UseCase: Located in the /app/usecase folder, this is where the core business logic is implemented.
4. Repository: Located in the /app/repository folder, this handles data access, typically for database interactions.
5. Entity: Located in the /app/entity folder, this defines the objects used in both the use cases and repositories.

Additional:

/handler/grst folder: This folder is part of GRST and is generated from the proto files in the /contract folder. Generation is done using cdd and protoc-gen-cdd, which you can find at https://github.com/herryg91/cdd. Setting this up may be tricky, so this folder has been committed to GitHub for convenience.

## Database & Migrations
We are using PostgreSQL as the database. Migration files are located in the /migrations folder. There are several ways to done this:
1. Set RUN_MIGRATION into true in envar config. Golang goose will handle the migrations out of the box
2. Set RUN_MIGRATION into false, then run manually the sql scripts on the migrations folder.

## Environment Variable
Environment variables can be found in the /config folder and overridden in the .env file.
- REST_PORT: Sets the port on which the REST API will run
- GRPC_PORT: Sets the port on which gRPC will run
- DB_HOST, DB_PORT, and other DB_ prefixed variables: Configure your database connection settings here.
- AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET: Used to generate JWT tokens for session management.
- REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET: Used for generating JWT refresh tokens.
- PASSWORD_SALT: Salt used for JWT token creation. Changing this will affect user table seeding.
- VALIDATE_TOKEN_URL: URL for the token validation middleware, typically set to http://localhost:{REST_PORT}/validate.
- FLAT_INTEREST_RATE: Configures the annual flat rate, used in loan simulations and in generating loan and billing schedules.
- RUN_MIGRATION: if set into TRUE will run the migrations using embedded [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) everytime the application run

## Authentication & Auth Token
Some of the endpoints that has this statement `option (cdd.api.auth) = { needauth: true };` in the contract need an Authentication token set in the header which can be set like this:
```
Authorization: bearer {auth token}
```

To generate the auth token, there are two ways:
- Login Endpoint: Send a POST request to `{host}/user/login`. Detailed information can be found in `/contract/auth.proto`.
- gRPC Method: Call the GenerateToken method via gRPC. Detailed information can be found in `/contract/usertoken.proto`.

## Create New User
Run create-user script in `cmd/create-user`. This script requires 3 args:
1. --email or -e
2. --password or -p
3. --name or -n

example
```
./create-user -e admin@billing.com -p password123 -n admin
```
